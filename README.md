DEVELOPMENT OF NON-CONTACT TYPE EYE-SWITCH FOR ALS PATIENTS USING EYE MOVEMENT BASED ON PUPIL CENTER DETECTION
•	Utilized computer vision libraries such as Dlib face detection, ESRGAN+ image super-resolution (ISR), and OpenCV.
•	Designed a two-stage CNN structure to detect eye contour points and pupil center position.
•	Implemented advanced CNN models incorporating Fine-Tuning, Batch Normalization, and Drop Out techniques to improve accuracy.
•	Developed a system interface integrating the pupil center detection model for a nighttime nursing call system.
